## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is fully responsive on any device, and includes a contact form and image modals for easier viewing of images 
on mobile.

## Optimizations

Optimizations include improving accesibility such as adding image modals for mobile and larger text, as well as improving loading times of pages 
by compressing images to reduce file size.

## Lessons Learned:

During this project, I learned about how to work with a client to meet their demands. I learned how to connect different disparate ideas together and make them mesh. I also learned a lot about modals, as that was a necessary part of the project. I had a lot of fun learning about modals because of the use cases they bring. I am excited to see what else I can build that uses modals.
